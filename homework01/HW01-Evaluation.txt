Evaluation for homework 01: Calendar Stuff and CountTheDays

CalendarStuff and CountTheDays program
Includes running CalendarStuffTester test program
Includes running automated CountTheDays program
=================================================

Comments:
---------
You have two "bad count" errors on your "daysBetween()"" tests, on
03-31-2005 to 04-01-2005, and on 11-15-2005 to 10-10-2008.
You also have one error on your "CountTheDays" tests, on the same
test as you missed with daysBetween().

I'll have to take a wee bit off on that.  Otherwise, everything
works fine.

Very good job on this assignment!
