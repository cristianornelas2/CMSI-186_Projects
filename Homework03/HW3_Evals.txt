Evaluation for homework 03: ClockSolver

Clock and ClockSolver programs
Includes running Clock main to observe tests
Includes running automated ClockSolver tests
   View testHW3.bat in your repo to see test parameters used
============================================================

Point structure for this assignment is one point wherever indicated.
There are a total of ten points for running ClockSolver with various
input values.  For each test, you get credit if you find *at least*
one occurrence of the angle and log it's time.

You get credit for the main() method for testing the Clock methods,
since I gave that code to you for free.  If you didn't add any more
tests to it, consider doing so from now on, so you'll get full credit
for testing in the module.

You also get credit for error checking code as follows:
   if you error check in the main, you get freebie credit for the
      error checking methods
   if you error check by calling the ClockSolver method, you get
      freebie credit for the other two error checking methods
   if you error check using all three, GOOD FOR YOU!! You are an
      increasingly competent Java programmer!!

Total 23 out of 27 = 85.19% which is a solid B

I got an exception when running with an angle of "abc" which should
have been caught.  Check your logic on that and make sure you are doing
the conversion from string to double inside a try/catch block to keep
that from happening.

You only got time outputs for five of the test cases, so I can't give you
full credit.  There were others where you found one or two times, but not
all of them, I gave you credit for those.

Nice work, Cristian!
