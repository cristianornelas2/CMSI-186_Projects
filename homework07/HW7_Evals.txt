Evaluation
==========

   35.67 out of 34 = 104.90% which is an A-plus

You missed a couple of the EC tests.  You didn't detect that there were two
copies of the 12-cent coin in the final standalone test, and you got an
ArrayOutOfBoundsException for running with only a 3-cent coin as argument.

Near perfect job, Cristian...  Nice work and a great finish to the semester!
